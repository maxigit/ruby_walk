<% require "lib/ruby_walk" %>
# Introduction
This gem provides the ability to *walk* recursively amongs an object and its dependencies, ie executing a optional block and storing the result in a flat list.
The dependecies are give as hash associating a class and its dependencies (a list of symbols to call on the object).
The `walk_objects` methods can be used either to generate a flat list of an object and its dependencies or to just to iterate over them.

## Examples
Lets consider a Rails like example

    Class User
      has_many :posts
    end

    Class Post
      :has_many :comments
    end


    user.walk_objects(:user => [:posts], :posts =>[:comments])

will generate a list containing, the user, all its posts, and all of the associated comments


## Filtering
to filter the element to be walked use a block. If a block return `nil` then element and its dependencies are skiped. If the result is `[]` the element is not returned in the result but its dependencies are walked.

With the previous example, to get only the list of comments

    user.walk_objects(:user => :posts, :posts =>:comments) { |e| e.is_a?(Comment) ? e : [])

### Walking over a hash
use  `:keys` and or `:values`.

To get all the final value of a Hash

<% example = {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => {:a => 3, :d => 5}} %>
<% to_eval = %Q{#{example.inspect}.walk_objects(Hash => :values){ |e| e.is_a?(Hash) ? [] : e }} %>
    <%=  to_eval%>
    > <%=  eval(to_eval).inspect%>


### Walking over a list
by default a List walk over its elements and excludes itself.


<% example = [[1,2], [3,2], [[5,6, [7,8]]]] %>
<% to_eval = %Q{#{example.inspect}.walk_objects(){ |x| x*10 }} %>
    <%=  to_eval%>
    > <%=  eval(to_eval).inspect%>
